1.0 Intro to lighttpd with wolfSSL

Lighttpd is a lightweight web server we have ported wolfSSL to. The goal of
this manual is to help the user get started with Lighttpd using the wolfSSL
library for SSL and TLS operations.

1.1 Current Status Notes

wolfSSL offers support based in the United States as well as
training! With our dual-licensing options, wolfSSL can provide you with the
solution that you need for your commercial application or open source project.

2.0 INSTALLATION

2.1 Dependencies

The lighttpd with wolfSSL requires the wolfSSL library version 3.15.3 or
later.  Future releases of wolfSSL can be obtained from http://www.wolfssl.com.
By default, lighttpd and wolfSSL install their libraries in different locations,
making use of the `--prefix` option can help ensure your library files are in
the expected locations.

To build and install wolfSSL for use with Lighttpd run the following commands
from the root wolfSSL directory:
    git clone https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl.git
    cd wolfssl
    ./autogen.sh (if cloned from a git repository)
    ./configure --enable-lighty
    make
    sudo make install
    sudo ldconfig (may additionally be required on some unix systems)

More details and information about wolfSSL can be found in the wolfSSL Manual,
available in both PDF and HTML formats from the wolfSSL Documentation page.

Note: autogen.sh requires autconf and libtool.

2.2 Building Lighttpd

When building Lighttpd on Linux, or OS X, use the autoconf system.  To build
Lighttpd, run the following two commands from Lighttpd’s top level directory:
    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure --with-wolfssl=yes [--without-bzip2] [--without-zlib] [--without-pcre]
    make

The `--with-wolfssl` option defaults to installing the wolfSSL libraries in the
`/usr/local` directory. If a path is provided like --with-wolfssl=/usr then 
it is used as the library location.

To install lighttpd, run the following command:
    sudo make install
    sudo ldconfig (may additionally be required on some unix systems)

By default, the Lighttpd library is installed in the /usr/local/lib directory.

3.0 EXAMPLE SERVER

Once you’ve installed Lighttpd and wolfSSL as explained in section 2, we’ve
provided a directory containing an example server setup: docs/wolfssl in the
lighttpd root directory.  The directory contains the following:

    lighttpd.conf: a simple conf file that lighttpd will run.  It uses
    localhost, and the port 443. It should only work with https.

    To generate a self-signed certificate for testing purposes, please refer to
    on-line documentation at lighttpd.net and place the server.pem file in the
    ./docs/wolfssl directory.
    https://redmine.lighttpd.net/projects/lighttpd/wiki/Docs_SSL#Self-Signed-Certificates

    server.pem: the server’s certificate (the client will need to authenticate
    the server).

    index.html: the index page which will be returned on an https GET. It says:
    "Congratulations!!!  You got Lighttpd with wolfSSL to run."  When you see
    this, you know you’re doing something right.

3.1  To run the lighttpd server: in the ./docs/wolfssl directory enter
the following:

    sudo /usr/local/sbin/lighttpd -D -f lighttpd.conf

Successful output:  2015-07-17 14:01:52: (log.c.164) server started

3.2 Testing with the wolfSSL client program:

To run without verifying the server’s cert (in the wolfssl directory):
    ./examples/client/client -p 443 -g -d

This will send a GET request, and on success the contents of the index.html
should be displayed on the terminal (along with a lot of other stuff):
    Congratulations!!!  You got Lighttpd with wolfSSL to run.

To run and verify the server’s cert (in wolfssl directory):
    ./examples/client/client -p 443 -g -A /path/to/lighttpd/doc/wolfssl/server.pem

On success, the same congratulatory output should be displayed.

Browser: in the browser type:
    https://127.0.0.1

Accept the complaints about unrecognized certs to see the page without server.
Page should show same congratulatory text as above.

4.0 Debugging

To get debug messages from wolfSSL code you must configure with the `--enable-debug` option:
    ./configure --enable-lighty --enable-debug

To turn on the wolfSSL debugging the following must be added to lighttpd:
./src/server.c: main() before any wolfSSL functions are called:
    wolfSSL_Debugging_ON();

After you have done this, wolfSSL debug messages will be printed to stderr.

The following line in the lighttpd.conf will specify the lighttpd log file:
    server.errorlog = "./server_err.log"

Prior to the log being opened, log messages will be directed to stderr.

4.1 PK Callbacks

If you'd like to use this with external crypto hardware for ECC then you can build
wolfSSL with the `./configure --enable-pkcallbacks` option. The reference PK callbacks
are in the src/mod_openssl.c file. Search for HAVE_WOLFSSL_PK_CALLBACKS to locate the reference
functions.
